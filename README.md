This includes files for Project #1
The goal of this project to analyze the AirPurple air quality data gathered from all around the state of Nebraska. This is to better understand air quality patterns, evaluate compliance with National Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), and identify potential air quality risk to Nebraskans all-round the state.
Task 1: Data Preparation
The engineers will import AirPurple air quality data into python for analysis. The data will be checked by verifying sensor names, pollutant units, and geographic location to ensure accuracy and consistency throughout the data. All the data will then be grouped by the sensor names to allow for location-based comparisons in the data.
Task 2: Analysis of Pollutants
For the next task the engineers determine summary statistics. This includes average concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOC), PM2.5, and PM10 for each sensor location. Locations will be ranked by concentration levels of pollution. The top 5 locations with the highest averages of pollutants will be identified and documented.
Task 3: Location Analysis
Once the maximum recorded values for each pollutant will be identified across all locations. The engineers then determine exactly when and where this maximums occurred. Research will then be conducted in those areas to find potential human related factors, or possible environmental factors causing the pollution. These environmental factors could include weather conditions, wildfire smoke, agricultural activity, or possibly urban emissions.
Task 4: Environmental Evaluation
The temperature and humidity will then be categorized according to client provided instructions. Pollution concentration will then be compared across temperature categories and humidity levels. Using statistics and visualizations will be used to evaluate whether temperature and humidity play a noticeable effect on the air quality throughout the state.
Task 5: Pollutant concentrations will then be turned into Air Quality Index (AQI) categories using guidelines for PM2.5 and PM10. Once that is complete, engineers will then identify specific locations and time periods that could be potentially unhealthy for sensitive groups of people. These health risk events will be discussed and be further researched.
